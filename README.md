# UNSEEN

An interactive, scroll-driven 3D experience exploring mental health as an internal landscape.

UNSEEN does not explain mental health through text or data.  
It visualizes it through motion, instability, collapse, overload, and partial recovery — the way it is often felt rather than described.

The experience unfolds as the user scrolls, moving the camera through an abstract “mind-space.” A brain-like structure evolves over time, responding to invisible pressures: agitation, withdrawal, fragmentation, and slow re-alignment. There is no clear beginning or resolution — only progression.

This project is intentionally quiet.  
There are no instructions, no UI, no narrative captions. Meaning emerges through observation and sensation.

## Concept

Mental health is often invisible from the outside while intensely real on the inside.  
UNSEEN treats the mind as an environment rather than a subject — something you move through, not something explained to you.

Each phase represents a different internal state:
- calm and baseline coherence  
- anxiety and overstimulation  
- depressive collapse and distance  
- burnout and fragmentation  
- resilience as an imperfect, partial return  

The work avoids dramatization or resolution. Recovery is not depicted as a full restoration, but as a subtle reorganization.

## Interaction

- Scrolling controls the camera and progression
- Motion and transformation are continuous
- No explicit controls or instructions
- The experience is meant to be explored slowly

---

## Technical Overview

- Pure frontend implementation
- Three.js (WebGL)
- Procedural geometry (no external 3D models)
- Scroll-based camera and state control
- Single-file architecture for stability and accessibility

The technical approach is deliberately minimal to keep focus on the experience rather than the tooling.

## Intent

  
It is a visual study — an attempt to represent internal states that are often difficult to articulate.

The project is open-ended by design. Interpretation is left to the viewer.

## Viewing Notes

For best results:
- Use a desktop browser
- Scroll slowly
- View in a quiet environment
- Allow the transitions to unfold without rushing
